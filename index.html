        <h1>STAY INFORMED ON ACTIVE 4CHAN THREADS</h1>
        <p>
            Velkommen til vores hjemmeside. Her udforsker vi Israel-Palæstina-konflikten på internetforummet 4chan. Du finder både information om selve konflikten og om, hvordan den udfolder sig på 4chan. Vi ser nærmere på udvalgte threads, der belyser konflikten, og dykker ned i, hvordan brugere diskuterer og fortolker emnet. Vi undersøger, hvordan holdninger formes, og hvordan radikale synspunkter opstår. Da platformen 4chan hovedsageligt består af anonyme brugere og stort set ikke har moderation, opstår et unikt miljø for debat og udveksling af synspunkter. Hvis du ønsker en bredere forståelse af konflikten og 4chan, har vi tilføjet nogle links nederst på siden.</p>

In recent years, public support for a two-state solution has decreased, with Israeli policy reflecting an interest in maintaining the occupation rather than seeking a permanent resolution to the conflict. In 2007, Israel tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip and made official its policy of isolating it from the West Bank.
